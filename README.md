I made a simple form and did not really put any effort in the design. 
I tried to make sure I used the correct elements and labeled everything efficiently, hope I did okay with that. 
I have labels for the input fields and I put some text under the required fields for explanation. Because of the way the text is placed the screen reader should read it along with the labels and input fields.
I only changed the focus state of the button, it was the only element that I felt wasn't highlighted enough by default.

I checked the page with a contrast tester and tested it out with a screen reader and it seems to work fine!
